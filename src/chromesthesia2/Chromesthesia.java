package chromesthesia2;


/*
 * This program interprets melodic lines given in ABC notation as a
 * chromesthete might.
 *
 * A Pitch class will be defined, and will take center stage in the
 * processing.
 *
 * Interpreting a melody in ABC notation will amount to flashing
 * colored rectangles for prescribed durations, while sounding
 * the pitch! The color of the rectangle will correspond to pitch
 * class. The duration will correspond to the duration of the note.
 *
 * For this first version of the program, the duration will be held
 * constant at 1 beat.
 *
 * Three sorts of images will appear on the screen, the chromesthetic
 * output box, a text box, and an error message box. Simplicity
 * of design is rendered by permitting only one box to be on the screen
 * at a time.
 *
 * ABC represents notes in a manner consistent with these examples:
 * C, D, E, C D E c d e
 *
 * Google ABC  music representation if you would like to know more about it.
